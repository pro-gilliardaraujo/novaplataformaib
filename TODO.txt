## Implementation Steps for Each Page
1. Delete existing page content
2. Copy base structure from Tratativas page
3. Update types and interfaces
4. Implement page-specific components:
   - Table component with integrated pagination
   - Details Modal
   - Edit Modal (if needed)
5. Update API calls and data handling
6. Test functionality
7. Verify UI consistency

## UI Standards to Follow
- Table standards:
  - Rename "Ações" column to "Detalhes"
  - Single Eye icon centered in details column
  - All action buttons (edit, delete, etc.) must be in details modal
  - Row height must be exactly 49px
  - 15 rows per page
  - Filter icon beside sorting buttons
  - Proper header text alignment
  - Pagination must be part of table structure with border-t
- Modal patterns:
  - Rounded buttons (h-8 w-8 rounded-md shadow-sm)
  - Consistent header layout
  - Standard section divisions
  - All action buttons for item manipulation
  - Edit/Delete/Other actions in modal header with tooltips
  - Confirmation dialog for delete actions

## Notes
- Each dropdown item from sidebar will become a tab content
- Single entry point for each main section
- Reuse components where possible
- Maintain consistent styling across all pages
- Action buttons should always be in details modal, not in table
